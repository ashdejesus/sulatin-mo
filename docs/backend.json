By storing each user's data under a path directly derived from their Firebase UID (`/users/{uid}`), we achieve path-based ownership, which is the most secure and efficient method. \n\nAuthorization Independence: There is no dependency on parent document data, as each user document stands alone and authorization is solely based on the `request.auth.uid` matching the document ID. This avoids `get()` calls in security rules and enables atomic operations.\n\nQAPs: The structure supports secure `list` operations because access to user data is strictly controlled by the user's UID.  Listing operations on `/users` are prevented at the root level and writes are limited to authenticated users, thereby preventing unauthorized data access."
